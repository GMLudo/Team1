:dart: Assignment Week 2
---
You are diving into the open source ecosystem and will take a closer look at some open source communities. This week is about understanding how open source communities organize, who is involved, and where to find this kind of information.

**Goal**: Describe your community governance and identify key players.

Four communities to look at:

    FreeBSD
    Node.js
    two more communities from your week 1 list


**Task**: As a team and for each of your open source communities, look at the governance documents, observe key members in these communities, identify the artifacts the communities are working on, and familiarize yourself with the community.


**Deliverable**: A markdown document for each community describing its mission, its governance, key members, artifacts, and other noteworthy characteristics.
